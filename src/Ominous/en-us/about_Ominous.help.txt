LONG DESCRIPTION
    
    OMINOUS is a markdown generator for PowerShell. Use the commands to write 
    markdown in a fluent manner or mnemonically invoking conventions.

    Other notable features included in OMINOUS:
    
    -- Markdown flavor support
    -- Preferences
    -- Type Mappers: map a type to another type before converting to markdown
    -- Attribute based stylings
    -- Inherit nested value conversion

    [!IMPORTANT]
    All commands output a leading and trailing line for all block commands 
    (not inline commands (i.e., image and links))

MNEMONIC INVOCATION

    Every command has aliases and names that are interpreted at time of invocation. 

    For example, to create a header you would simply do the following:

    ```powershell
    ConvertTo-Heading 'Hello World' -Level 2
    ```

    Mnemonic invocation of that same command reduces the syntax footprint:

    ```powershell
    H2 'Hello World'
    ```

    In addition to syntax sugar, in cases where the command has properties, they 
    are mutated inherently for you. So in the same example above:

    ```PowerShell
    H2 'Hello World'
    ```

    The `Level` property is set to 2 for you, so you no longer need to provide it
